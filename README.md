# CPU Scheduling Algorithms FCFS and SRTF Implementation using Java

This project contains Java implementations of two CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF).

## FCFS Algorithm
The FCFS algorithm is a simple scheduling algorithm that schedules processes in the order in which they arrive in the ready queue. The implementation of the FCFS algorithm can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/marwan-mohamed12/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms/blob/main/FCFS/fcfs/src/fcfs/Fcfs.java">Fcfs.java</a> file. The program reads in the processes and outputs the waiting time, completion time and turnaround time for each process.

## SRTF Algorithm
The SRTF algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that schedules processes based on the remaining burst time of each process. The implementation of the SRTF algorithm can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/marwan-mohamed12/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms/blob/main/srt/src/srt/Srt.java">Srt.java</a> file. The program reads in the processes and outputs the waiting time, completion time and turnaround time for each process.
