# CPU Scheduling Algorithms FCFS and SRTF Implementation using Java

This project contains Java implementations of two CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF).

## FCFS Algorithm
The FCFS algorithm is a simple scheduling algorithm that schedules processes in the order in which they arrive in the ready queue. The implementation of the FCFS algorithm can be found in the FCFS file. The program reads in the processes and outputs the waiting time, completion time and turnaround time for each process.

## SRTF Algorithm
The SRTF algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that schedules processes based on the remaining burst time of each process. The implementation of the SRTF algorithm can be found in the SRT file. The program reads in the processes and outputs the waiting time, completion time and turnaround time for each process.
